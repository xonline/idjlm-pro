# Changelog

All notable changes to IDJLM Pro are documented here.

---

## [2.8.2] — 2026-04-08

### Status Bar Visibility
- **Brighter stats bar** — increased font size (12→13px), changed text colour from dimmed secondary to bright primary. Numbers now bold (700 weight). Progress bar thicker (4→6px, wider).
- **API key placeholder text brighter** — masked keys like "sk-ant...xyz1 — saved" now visible instead of ghost text.

### Operation Started Toasts
- **"Analysis started — 41 tracks to go"** — toast popup when you click Analyse All, Classify, or Write Tags. No more wondering if the button worked.
- **"Classification started — this may take a few minutes"**
- **"Writing tags to X files — do not close the app"**

### Cancel Button
- **Red "✕ Cancel" button** appears next to the progress bar during analysis, classification, and tag writing.
- Click it to stop the operation midway. Shows "Operation cancelled" toast.
- Calls the existing `/api/progress/<op_id>/cancel` endpoint.

---

## [2.8.1] — 2026-04-08

### Critical Hotfix
- **PyInstaller missing `unittest` module** — Removed `--exclude-module "unittest"` and added `--hidden-import "unittest"` to the GitHub Actions workflow and local build script. This was breaking all audio analysis in the built DMG (librosa requires unittest). Every track showed "Audio analysis failed: No module named 'unittest'".
- **Also added `--hidden-import "scipy.special.cython_special"`** — another librosa/scipy dependency that was causing silent failures.

### Layout Fix
- **Stats dashboard moved to Organise tab** — Was pushing the track table off-screen in the Library tab. Now the Library tab is a clean track table with filter bar. Stats (collection summary, charts, Camelot wheel, age analysis) live in the Organise tab alongside Library Health.

### DMG Improvements
- **Drag-and-drop to Applications** — DMG now includes IDJLM Pro.app + Applications symlink side by side. Just drag the app to the Applications folder.

### Localisation
- **Australian English** — All user-facing text now uses AU spelling: analyse, analysed, analysing (not analyze/analyzed/analyzing). API paths, variable names, and code internals unchanged.

---

## [2.8.0] — 2026-04-08

### AI That Learns From Your Corrections
- Every approval or edit is saved as a correction pattern (artist, BPM range, energy)
- Correction hints injected into future classification prompts — the AI gets *your* taste
- Learning dashboard shows total corrections, unique patterns, and top corrections table
- Reset Learning button in Settings tab

### Energy Timeline of a Planned Set
- Chart.js line chart in Setlist tab showing energy flow across your set
- Color-coded points (blue=low, green=mid, amber=high, red=peak)
- Auto-generated summary: "Classic warm-up → peak → cool-down arc" or "Flat energy — consider variety"
- Hidden when fewer than 2 tracks have energy data

### LUFS / Loudness Analysis
- EBU R128-style integrated LUFS, LUFS Range (LRA), and True Peak analysis
- K-weighted pre-filtering, 400ms windowed RMS, relative threshold gating
- LUFS column in track table with color-coded badges (green/amber/red)
- LUFS, LUFS Range, True Peak in track detail panel
- Average LUFS in collection summary stats

### Playlist Management
- New "Playlists" tab in sidebar — create, save, run, export playlists
- Filter builder: genre, subgenre, BPM range, energy range, key, status, year range
- Export playlists as M3U for Djay import
- Ad-hoc filter runs without saving

### Key Compatibility Graph
- Full-screen modal with Canvas-based network visualization
- Nodes = tracks (colored by genre, grouped by key), edges = harmonic compatibility
- Force-directed layout with 60 refinement iterations
- Interactive: hover for details, click to highlight connections
- Handles up to 200 nodes

### Check for Updates
- Click version badge in header or "Check for Updates" in Settings
- Compares your version against GitHub latest release
- Downloads .dmg to ~/Downloads with progress bar
- Opens DMG when done — just drag to Applications
- Git-pull option for source installs

### SSL Certificate Auto-Fix
- All HTTPS requests now use certifi CA bundle automatically
- No manual "Install Certificates.command" needed on macOS
- Graceful fallback if certifi not installed
- Added certifi to requirements.txt

### Collection Age Analysis (from v2.7.1)
- Decade distribution bar chart, genre-era breakdown
- Salsa Clasica/Romantica/Moderna, Bachata Tradicional/Moderna era labels
- Median year, oldest/newest tracks

### Shared Taxonomy Templates (from v2.7.1)
- Export/import taxonomy as JSON
- 4 built-in templates: Salsa Complete, Bachata Complete, Latin Multi, Social DJ Essentials

### Tests
- 80 tests passing (1 pre-existing numpy skip in system Python)

---

## [2.7.1] — 2026-04-08

### High Impact Features
- **Tag backup & restore** — Before writing tags, current ID3 values are backed up. Restore from any backup point via the Organise tab. Auto-cleanup removes backups older than 7 days (max 20 kept).
- **Re-classify workflow** — Select tracks, pick an AI provider (Claude/Gemini/OpenRouter/Ollama), force re-classify with a specific model. New modal in the bulk actions bar.
- **Parallel analysis** — ThreadPoolExecutor (4 workers) for audio analysis. ~4x speedup on large libraries. SSE progress shows "(parallel)" indicator.
- **Import filters** — Filter by file type (checkboxes), date range (modified after/before), and exclude subfolders (comma-separated strings). Collapsible filter panel below folder picker.

### Medium Impact Features
- **Drag-and-drop setlist reordering** — Native HTML5 DnD on setlist items. Visual drop indicator, saves order immediately on drop.
- **Smart Playlist builder** — New "Playlists" tab with saved filter queries. Filter by genre, sub-genre, BPM range, energy, key, status. Run anytime against current library.
- **Latin features UI integration** — "Analyse Latin" button in pipeline. Cue points shown in track detail panel. Mix score badges in setlist. "Mix Well With" suggestions in track detail.
- **Duplicate merge workflow** — Radio buttons to select which duplicate to keep, merge best fields from others. Shows summary of merged fields.
- **Library-wide search** — Server-side search across 17 fields (title, artist, genre, key, album, comments, reasoning, file path, clave...). Debounced at 300ms. Existing genre/status filters still work on top.
- **Export filtering UI** — Modal with genre, sub-genre, status, BPM, key, energy filters before export. "Export All" bypasses filters. Works for M3U, CSV, JSON, Rekordbox XML.

### Nice to Have
- **Keyboard shortcut reference** — Press `?` or `Cmd+/` to open shortcut cheat sheet. `1-4` for tabs, `/` for search, `Ctrl+S` save session, `Enter`/`Delete` for approve/skip.
- **Progress bar visualization** — Colored progress bar in stats bar (blue=analyse, green=classify, amber=write). Shows percentage during all SSE operations.
- **Post-write change summary** — After writing tags, toast shows "X written, Y changed" with expandable detail of actual field changes.
- **Mobile-responsive CSS** — 3 breakpoints (1024/768/480px). Sidebar collapses to icons, table scrolls horizontally, modals go full-width, touch-friendly 44px tap targets.

### Tests
- **80 tests passing** (1 pre-existing numpy skip in system Python)

---

## [2.6.0] — 2026-04-08

### New Features
- **Cascading provider → model selector in Settings** — Provider dropdown (Anthropic / OpenRouter / Gemini / Ollama) drives which API key section is shown and populates the model dropdown live from the provider's API.
- **Dynamic model listing endpoint (`POST /api/list_models`)** — Queries each provider's API for available models. OpenRouter models show free/paid badges based on pricing.
- **Model refresh button** — Re-fetch the model list at any time without saving first.

### Improvements
- **Gemini API compatibility (2026+)** — Supports both new `google.genai` and legacy `google.generativeai` APIs with automatic fallback from gemini-2.5-flash to gemini-2.0-flash.
- **Analysis logging** — Added detailed logger output for track analysis including per-track success/failure and summary counts.
- **Settings save reloads env** — `load_dotenv(override=True)` called after writing `.env` so changes take effect immediately without restart.
- **OpenRouter default model updated** — Default changed from `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` to `google/gemini-2.5-flash:free`.

### Tests
- **7 new tests** for `/api/list_models` endpoint (missing provider, unknown provider, claude/gemini without keys, ollama, openrouter).
- **82 total tests** passing.

---

## [2.5.9] — 2026-04-07

### Bug Fixes
- **Analysis results not showing in table** — SSE `onComplete` callbacks now refetch `GET /api/tracks` after every pipeline operation (analyse, classify, write tags).
- **JS runtime errors breaking page** — `getFilteredTracks()` now guards against missing DOM elements. `renderStatsDashboard()` only calls Chart.js methods if `typeof Chart !== 'undefined'`.
- **Stats dashboard crashing on empty library** — `renderStatsDashboard()` now exits early if `window.tracks` is empty.

---

## [2.5.8] — 2026-04-07

### Critical Fixes
- **Analysis complete but nothing shows** — SSE `onComplete` callbacks expected `data.tracks` but backend only sent summary counts. Now refetches `GET /api/tracks` after every pipeline operation (analyse, classify, write tags). Table updates correctly.
- **AppleScript routes not wired** — `applescript_bp` existed but was never registered in `create_app()`. Now registered. djay Pro integration is live.
- **Folder watcher only watched MP3** — Now watches all supported formats: MP3, FLAC, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, AIFF, AIF.
- **AIFF files unsupported** — Added `.aiff` and `.aif` to `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`.

### New Features
- **OpenRouter AI model** — Access 100+ models (Gemini, Claude, Llama, Mistral, etc.) via single API key. Free models available. Configurable model via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` env var (default: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`).
- **BPM confidence score** — `bpm_confidence` (0-100) computed from onset strength peak clarity. Shows which analyses are reliable.
- **Key confidence score** — `key_confidence` (0-100) computed from chroma template correlation strength.
- **Camelot Wheel visualization** — Stats tab now shows an SVG Camelot wheel with key distribution (darker = more tracks in that key).
- **Stats dashboard upgrade** — Collection summary card (total, % analysed, % classified, % approved), key distribution chart, energy distribution chart.
- **Genre normalization** — Auto-maps common genre variants ("Salsa Romántica" → "Salsa", "Reggaetón" → "Reggaeton") on import. Reduces AI classification errors.
- **Multi-source metadata enrichment** — MusicBrainz (free, no key) and Discogs (optional token) added as fallbacks when Spotify enrichment fails.
- **Bulk Edit button** — "Bulk Edit" button in bulk actions bar opens the bulk edit modal for selected tracks.

### Improved
- **Energy recalibration** — Perceptual model combining RMS + spectral centroid + onset density instead of naive RMS-only mapping.
- **SSE `refetch` flag** — All `done` events now include `refetch: true` so frontend knows to refresh track data.
- **Config template** — `config.example.env` expanded with all options, AI model choices, and documentation links.

---

## [2.5.7] — 2026-04-07

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Session resume broken — `load_session()` always failed** — `Track.to_dict()` serialised 8 computed properties (`display_title`, `final_genre`, `final_bpm`, etc.) that are not dataclass fields. `Track(**track_dict)` in `load_session()` raised `TypeError` for every track, causing a silent total data loss on resume. Now filters `track_dict` to only dataclass fields before reconstruction.
- **Classification 10× slower than necessary** — `/api/classify` looped through tracks calling `classify_service([track])` individually, defeating the built-in batch optimisation. Now collects all tracks and passes them at once; the service batches them per `CLASSIFY_BATCH_SIZE` (default 10). 1 API call per 10 tracks instead of 1 per track.

### Frontend Bug Fixes
- **Bulk edit saved 0 tracks** — `handleBulkEdit()` sent `file_paths` but backend expected `track_paths`. Fixed to send `track_paths`.
- **Double search listener** — `initTracksTab()` and `initSearchFeature()` both attached `input` listeners to `#search-tracks`, causing double-filtering and stale `_searchMatch` state. Removed the duplicate from `initTracksTab()`.
- **Confidence badges unstyled** — JS returned `confidence-medium` but CSS defined `.confidence-mid`. Renamed JS to use `confidence-mid`.
- **Settings threshold not loading** — `loadSettings()` read from `#settings-auto-approve-threshold` (non-existent); HTML has `#settings-auto-approve` (range slider). Fixed both `loadSettings()` and `saveSettingsRound2()` to use the correct ID. Also updates the displayed value text on load.
- **Settings saved wrong key name** — `saveSettingsRound2()` sent `batch_size` but backend expects `classify_batch_size`. Fixed.
- **Genre filter duplicated options** — `populateGenreFilters()` appended options without clearing, causing duplicates on every taxonomy reload. Now resets to `<option value="">All Genres</option>` first.
- **Organise tab crash on first run** — `runOrganise()` accessed `_previewData` property without checking if preview was run first. Now shows a warning toast if no preview data exists.
- **Genre select listener leak** — `openEditModal()` added a new `change` listener to the genre select on every open, accumulating handlers. Now clones and replaces the element to clear stale listeners.

### CSS Fixes
- **Stray closing brace** removed after `.sync-button-tooltip` rule
- **Added missing classes**: `.data-table`, `.btn-accent`, `.btn-sm`, `.nav-badge`
- **Added missing setlist/suggestion classes**: `.setlist-track-number`, `.setlist-track-duration`, `.suggestion-title`, `.suggestion-meta`
- **Added missing track detail classes**: `.track-detail-title-header`, `.track-detail-artist`, `.track-detail-album`, `.track-detail-classification`, `.classification-item`

### Backend Fixes
- **Analyser crash on silent/corrupt audio** — `librosa.beat.beat_track` can return an empty array; `.item()` raised `IndexError`. Now checks array size and raises a descriptive error.
- **Album art content-type not validated** — Spotify URL could return HTML (redirect/error) and write it as image data to ID3. Now validates `Content-Type` starts with `image/` and derives correct MIME type.
- **`_normalize_energy` unused parameters** removed (`sr`, `hop_length`).

### Testing
- **New test suite** (`tests/test_bugfixes.py`) — 11 new tests covering session round-trip, bulk edit payload, settings fields, taxonomy CRUD, analyser edge cases, static file validation, and review response shapes.
- **All 70 tests pass** (69 passed, 1 skipped).

---

## [2.5.6] — 2026-04-06

### Bug Fixes
- **"Analysis stream error: undefined"** — SSE progress endpoint was sending plain `data:` messages (browser `message` events), but the frontend listened for named events (`progress`, `complete`). No handlers ever fired; the connection silently closed and triggered the error toast with `undefined`. Fixed by emitting `event: progress` / `event: complete` named events. Keep-alive pings now use SSE comment syntax (`: ping`) to avoid being mistaken for data.
- **Error toast showed "undefined"** — `connectToProgress` passed a raw DOM `Event` to `onError`, which has no `.message`. Now wraps it in `new Error('Connection lost')` so the message is always readable.

### Improvements
- **API key confirmation** — Saved keys now display first 4 + last 4 characters in the input placeholder (e.g. `sk-a...xyz1  —  saved ✓`) so users can confirm which key is stored without exposing the full value.
- **Save button feedback** — Save button flashes green with "✓ Saved" for 2 seconds after a successful settings save.
- **Settings reload** — `loadSettings()` now also populates the Anthropic key placeholder and syncs AI model, Ollama model, batch size, and auto-approve threshold fields on every load.

---

## [2.5.5] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **`/api/analyse` and `/api/classify` still crashing (500)** — `get_json()` without `silent=True` was present in both `analyse_tracks` (line 100) and `classify_tracks` (line 163) in `import_routes.py`. Both now use `get_json(silent=True) or {}`. Applied the same fix to all remaining routes app-wide (latin, watch, organise, track, review, setplan, key, settings, bulk, setlist).
- **`session.json` read-only error** — `session_service.py` wrote `session.json` to the bundle root (read-only inside `.app`). Now writes to `~/Library/Application Support/IDJLM Pro/session.json` (macOS) / `~/.idjlm-pro/session.json` (other). Session persists across launches and survives app updates.

---

## [2.5.4] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Taxonomy edits failing (settings save → 500)** — `PUT /api/taxonomy` tried to write `taxonomy.json` to the read-only `.app` bundle path. Now writes to `~/Library/Application Support/IDJLM Pro/taxonomy.json` (macOS). All three write sites fixed (full replace, add genre, delete genre). Taxonomy is also loaded from the user-writable copy on startup so edits persist across launches.
- **`/api/analyse` and `/api/session/save` crash with empty body (500)** — `request.get_json()` without `silent=True` raised `BadRequest` when the body was empty or Content-Type missing. Fixed in `import_routes.py` and `session_routes.py`.

### Feature
- **Bulk Analyse selected tracks** — When tracks are selected via checkboxes, an "Analyse" button now appears in the bulk-actions bar. Only the selected tracks are sent to `/api/analyse`, with progress shown in the stats bar. Previously, only "Analyse All" was available.

---

## [2.5.3] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Audio preview "Could not load audio"** — Two fixes: (1) `play()` was called before the audio buffer was ready; now waits for `canplay` event. (2) Audio route only allowed `.mp3` — now supports FLAC, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG too. An `error` event handler shows a specific message if the file can't load at all.
- **Set Planner / Organise dropdowns too small** — Those tabs use `class="input"` but CSS only defined `.input-text` / `.input-select`. Added `.input` to the shared selector so font, height, padding and border match the rest of the app.
- **Settings loaded from wrong path on startup** — `run_app.py` loaded `.env` from the bundle path at startup, ignoring the user-directory settings file we fixed in v2.5.1. Now loads from `~/Library/Application Support/IDJLM Pro/.env` first.
- **No log file** — Errors from the bundled app were invisible. Now writes to `~/Library/Logs/IDJLM Pro/idjlm.log` (macOS) / `~/.idjlm-pro/logs/idjlm.log` (other). Rotating, max 2 MB × 3 backups.

---

## [2.5.2] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Genre not shown before AI classification** — `final_genre` now falls back to the file's existing genre tag (`existing_genre`). Tracks with genres already tagged in their files now show them immediately after import, before AI runs.
- **Wave column removed** — The "Wave" column showed waveform thumbnails only after audio analysis (librosa). Before analysis it always showed `—`. Removed entirely — it added visual noise without value at the typical workflow stage.

### Improvements
- **Set Planner arc button font** — Arc type buttons (Warm-Up, Peak Hour, etc.) now use the same 14px font as other form controls instead of the slightly-smaller 0.82rem.

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Settings lost on every launch (DMG)** — Settings were saved to `.env` at a path relative to the app bundle. When launched directly from a mounted DMG (read-only filesystem), writes failed silently and all settings were gone on next open. Settings now stored in `~/Library/Application Support/IDJLM Pro/.env` (macOS) or `~/.idjlm-pro/.env` (other platforms) — a user-writable location that persists across DMG launches, app updates, and reinstalls. Existing settings are migrated automatically on first launch.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Organise tab crash** — `initOrganiseTab()` was called from `switchTab()` but never defined, causing `ReferenceError` every time the Organise tab was clicked. Now defined; wires all buttons (health refresh, parse filenames, organise preview/run, key validator, duplicate scan) and triggers a health load on first visit.
- **Set Planner tab crash** — Same issue: `initSetPlanTab()` was called but never defined. Now defined; loads arc options, populates genre filter from taxonomy, and wires the Generate Set button.
- **Bulk edit modal buttons dead** — Save / Cancel / × buttons on the bulk-edit modal had no event listeners. Wired in `initBulkSelectFeature()`.
- **Bulk edit ID mismatch** — `handleBulkEdit()` read from `bulk-edit-genre/subgenre/bpm/year` but the HTML modal uses `bulk-genre/subgenre/bpm/year`. Fixed all four IDs.
- **Bulk edit genre select empty** — `showBulkEditModal()` now populates the genre `<select>` from `window.taxonomy` before opening.
- **Setlist never rendered** — `renderSetlist()` used wrong container IDs (`setlist-current-tracks` → `setlist-tracks`; `setlist-suggestions` → `setlist-suggestions-container`). Fixed. Empty-state / main-panel show/hide now works correctly using the static HTML elements.
- **Setlist footer overwritten** — `renderSetlist()` was dynamically replacing footer innerHTML, destroying the static Export M3U button. Now updates only `setlist-count` and `setlist-duration` span text.
- **`initSetlistTab()` silently bailed** — Was checking for the wrong container IDs (same mismatch), always returned early. Fixed and now called from `DOMContentLoaded`.
- **Export modal never wired** — `btn-export-csv/json/rekordbox` had no event listeners. Wired in `initBulkSelectFeature()` alongside the close button. Export modal can now be opened via the new "Export" button in the bulk-action bar.

### Improvements
- **Export button in bulk-action bar** — Selecting tracks and clicking "Export" now opens the Export Library modal (CSV / JSON / Rekordbox XML).
- **M3U export in setlist panel** — "Export M3U" button in the Set Planner setlist section now POSTs selected paths and triggers a download.

---

## [2.4.10] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **"Let's go" button unreadable on Pure Black theme** — `btn-primary` uses accent (`#e0e0e0`) as background with white text, making it invisible. Added `body.pure-black .btn-primary { color: #000000 }` so text is black on the near-white button.
- **Settings save not working** — `initSettingsTab()` was defined but never called from `DOMContentLoaded`; the Save button had no event listener attached. Fixed.
- **Settings threshold ID mismatch** — `saveSettings()` read from `settings-threshold` (non-existent) and referenced undefined `appState`; fixed to read from `settings-auto-approve` with safe fallback.
- **Track edit save → 404** — `saveTrackEdits()` used `encodeURIComponent(path)` in the URL path, but Flask's `<path:>` converter doesn't decode `%2F` as expected, causing lookup misses. Changed to `PUT /api/tracks/by-path?path=...` (query param). Same fix applied to the approve-button in the track table.
- **Bulk select bar never appeared** — JS referenced `id="bulk-actions-bar"` but HTML had `id="bulk-action-bar"` (no 's'). Fixed HTML id to match.
- **Audio playback failing** — `audio.play()` was called immediately after setting `audio.src` before the browser loaded the data. Added `audio.load()` before `audio.play()` in both `playTrack()` and `toggleAudioPlay()`. Also fixed `audio.src` absolute vs. relative comparison in `toggleAudioPlay()`.

### Improvements
- **One save button for Settings** — "Save All Settings" button now saves both API keys and taxonomy in one click. Separate "Save Taxonomy" button removed from UI.

---

## [2.4.9] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Tab switching broken** — Organise / Set Planner / Settings tabs were unclickable; `initNavigation()` was called in `DOMContentLoaded` but never defined. Added the function to wire `.nav-btn` click events to `switchTab()`.
- **Edit modal close/save/cancel broken** — `initEditModal()` was defined but never called on page load; all modal button listeners were never attached.
- **Audio player controls broken** — `initAudioPlayer()` was defined but never called; prev/next/seek/play-pause in the bottom bar didn't respond.
- **View details panel not opening** — `openTrackDetail()` toggled a CSS `.open` class but no CSS rule for that class existed; panel had inline `style="display:none"` that was never cleared. Fixed to use `style.display` directly. Also wired up the × close button and overlay-click to close.
- **Column preferences not loading** — `initColumnToggle()` was defined but never called; saved column visibility from localStorage was ignored on load.
- **Bulk select not wiring** — `initBulkSelectFeature()` and `initSearchFeature()` were defined but never called.

### Improvements
- **Default theme** — changed from `dark` to `pure-black`; new users no longer need to manually switch theme.
- **"Sub-Genre" renamed to "Comments"** — all UI labels (table column, edit modal, bulk edit, organise options, taxonomy editor, set planner filter) now read "Comments" to match industry terminology.

---

## [2.4.8] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Logo layout** — "IDJLM Pro" and version were stacking vertically (wrong CSS class `logo-container` → `logo`); now inline on one row with correct alignment

### Improvements
- **Native folder picker** — clicking "Change" or "Choose Folder" now opens a native OS folder dialog instead of a text input; no more typing file paths manually. Falls back to text input in dev/browser mode.

---

## [2.4.7] — 2026-04-05

### Improvements
- **Version in sidebar** — app version now shown next to "IDJLM Pro" in top-left (e.g. `IDJLM Pro v2.4.7`); reads from bundled VERSION file at runtime
- **PyInstaller bundle** — VERSION file now included in macOS DMG and Windows ZIP builds so version displays correctly in the packaged app

---

## [2.4.6] — 2026-04-05

### Improvements
- **Spotify dev link** — "Get credentials ↗" link to developer.spotify.com/dashboard added inline next to the Spotify Enrichment section label in Settings
- **Save Settings confirmation** — clicking Save now always shows a "Settings saved" toast; previously showed nothing when API key fields were empty (keys already saved appear masked in placeholders, so inputs look empty)

---

## [2.4.5] — 2026-04-05

### Features
- **4-theme system** — sidebar now shows 4 colour swatches; click to switch theme instantly
  - **Purple Dark** — original design (unchanged)
  - **Pro Booth** — amber/orange on deep charcoal; Pioneer CDJ/rekordbox aesthetic
  - **Studio Dark** — cyan on navy; Ableton/DAW aesthetic
  - **Pure Black** — true black with white typography; Spotify/Apple Music aesthetic
- Theme selection persists across sessions via `localStorage`

---

## [2.4.4] — 2026-04-05

### Native App (run_app.py)
- **Random port** — Flask now binds to a free ephemeral port instead of hardcoded 5050; overridable via `FLASK_PORT` env var
- **Close confirmation dialog** — pywebview window now prompts "Are you sure you want to close?" before quitting (prevents accidental data loss mid-session)

---

## [2.4.3] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Sort failure on null fields** — sorting by confidence/BPM/year no longer silently falls back to wrong order when values are None
- **Edited status never reverted** — clearing all overrides now correctly reverts track status from `edited` back to `pending`
- **Bulk-edit validation bypass** — `/api/review/bulk-edit` now validates BPM/key/year identically to the single-track endpoint

### Features
- **Harmonic mix suggestions** — `/api/mixes/compatible/<path>` endpoint now exists; returns top 10 compatible tracks by Camelot key (±1) + BPM (±8%)
- **Rekordbox INITIALKEY** — tag writer now writes `TXXX:INITIALKEY` alongside `TKEY` for full Rekordbox/Serato compatibility
- **Latin metadata in ID3** — clave pattern, energy score, vocal flag, tempo category now written as `COMM` frames (portable to all DJ tools)
- **Classifier clave + comment hints** — detected clave pattern and existing COMMENT tag now included in AI classification prompt; style hints added for Bachata/Salsa subgenre disambiguation
- **API retry with backoff** — Claude/Gemini rate limit errors (429) now retry 3× with 30s/60s/120s delays before falling back
- **Skip already-classified tracks** — "Classify All" skips tracks already classified; add `"force": true` to request body to reclassify all
- **Onboarding modal** — first-time users see a 6-step quick-start guide (dismissed via localStorage)
- **Setlist persistence** — setlist survives page refresh via localStorage; "Clear Setlist" button added

---

## [2.4.2] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **M3U export** — was broken; now uses native `fetch()` instead of `apiFetch()` so blob download works
- **Bulk selection** — never activated due to wrong DOM id (`track-table-body` → `tracks-tbody`)
- **Apple Music sync** — was sending full library instead of selection; fixed `Set.length` → `Set.size`
- **Review keyboard shortcuts (a/s)** — were no-ops; added missing `data-approve-btn`/`data-skip-btn` attributes
- **Stale folder path on session resume** — old sessions without `folder_path` metadata no longer corrupt auto-save path
- **Stack traces** — no longer leaked to frontend; all routes now log server-side and return generic error messages
- **Bulk approve parameter** — frontend/backend mismatch fixed (`threshold` → `min_confidence`; backend now accepts both)
- **Approval log race condition** — concurrent write-tag threads now use a lock to prevent log corruption

### Improvements
- **Search debounce** — 300ms debounce on library search; no more UI freeze while typing
- **Track table pagination** — 100 tracks per page with prev/next controls; eliminates browser slowdown on large libraries
- **Input validation** — BPM (40–300), Key (≤10 chars), Year (1900–2030) validated before saving; returns 400 on invalid input

---

## [2.4.1] — 2026-04-05

### Improvements
- **Gemini 2.0-flash** — classifier upgraded from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash` for better genre accuracy
- **Auto-save after classify & write-tags** — session persisted automatically so progress is never lost between steps
- **Keyboard navigation** — ↑/↓ arrows to move between tracks, Space to approve selected row
- **Threshold input** — confidence threshold is now an inline editable number field (was static text); value persists via `localStorage`
- **New app icon** — Nano Banana-generated vinyl record icon with purple-to-cyan gradient and neon waveform

### Bug Fixes (Codex-reviewed)
- **NaN threshold guard** — `parseInt("")` on cleared threshold input now falls back to `80` instead of `NaN`
- **Stale folder path on session resume** — `_current_folder_path` now restored from session metadata on load so auto-save works correctly in resumed sessions

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-05

![v2.4.0 screenshot](docs/screenshot-v2.4.0.png)

### UI Redesign — Single Library View
- **Sidebar trimmed to 4 items** — Library, Organise, Set Planner, Settings
- **Library toolbar** — folder picker + Analyse All + Classify All + Approve ≥N% + Write Tags on one row
- **Inline stats bar** — total/analysed/classified/approved always visible; progress bar appears during pipeline runs
- **Inline approve column** — approve/unapprove per row, no Review tab needed
- **SSE progress** — analyse/classify/write-tags progress shown inline in stats bar
- **Removed standalone tabs** — Import, Review, Stats, Taxonomy, Setlist, Wheel, Duplicates; content folded into Library / Settings / Set Planner / Organise
- **No backend changes** — all API routes unchanged

---

## [2.3.2] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Track data missing in UI** — `Track.to_dict()` used `dataclasses.asdict()` which excludes `@property` methods; all computed fields (`final_genre`, `final_bpm`, `final_key`, `display_title`, `display_artist`, `final_subgenre`, `final_year`, `final_comment`) now explicitly included in the serialised dict
- **Audio playback broken** — audio route changed from `/api/audio/<path:file_path>` to `/api/audio?path=...` (query param); `encodeURIComponent` was encoding `/` → `%2F` making Flask `os.path.abspath()` resolve to wrong path
- **Edit modal couldn't be closed** — JS errors from undefined track properties prevented event handlers; root cause fixed; Escape key handler added as belt-and-braces
- **Session lost on browser refresh** — session now auto-saved immediately after every import
- **No UX guidance after import** — toast now says "click Analyse All to extract BPM & key"; app auto-switches to Tracks tab after import so user can see what was loaded

### Track Model
- Added `override_comment` field and `final_comment` property (falls back to `proposed_subgenre` then `existing_comment`)

---

## [2.3.1] — 2026-04-05

### Launch UX
- **Splash screen on startup** — animated loading screen appears immediately when the app launches; no more blank bounce in the Dock for 5+ minutes on first run
- **Smart Flask wait** — app polls for Flask readiness instead of a fixed sleep; swaps splash → main UI the moment the server is up
- **Reduced bundle size** — excludes matplotlib, IPython, jupyter, notebook, test/unittest from PyInstaller build; cuts cold-start Gatekeeper scan time on macOS

### App Icon
- **Custom vinyl record icon** — dark rounded-square background, purple→teal gradient label, subtle groove rings, three-dot AI motif; generated from `assets/make_icon.py`
- macOS `.icns` and Windows `.ico` both auto-generated during CI build via `assets/make_icon.py` (Pillow); `iconutil` used on macOS runner for full multi-resolution `.icns`

---

### Audio Intelligence (computed during Analysis)
- **Vocal / Instrumental detector** — classifies each track as "vocal", "instrumental", or "mostly_instrumental" using harmonic separation + spectral flatness + MFCC variance; confidence 0–100
- **Tempo category** — genre-aware slow/medium/fast label (Bachata, Kizomba, Salsa, etc. each have calibrated BPM thresholds)

### Track Table
- Added Clave column (was in JS but missing from HTML header — fixed)
- Added Vocal column (badge: blue=Vocal, green=Instr., orange=Mostly Instr.)
- Added Tempo column (badge: red=Fast, orange=Medium, blue=Slow)

### Automation
- GitHub Actions workflow — auto-builds macOS DMG + Windows ZIP and creates GitHub release on every `v*.*.*` tag push
- `CHANGELOG.md` extracted from README into its own file; release notes populated automatically per version
