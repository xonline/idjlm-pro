# Changelog

All notable changes to IDJLM Pro are documented here.

---

## [2.5.3] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Audio preview "Could not load audio"** — Two fixes: (1) `play()` was called before the audio buffer was ready; now waits for `canplay` event. (2) Audio route only allowed `.mp3` — now supports FLAC, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG too. An `error` event handler shows a specific message if the file can't load at all.
- **Set Planner / Organise dropdowns too small** — Those tabs use `class="input"` but CSS only defined `.input-text` / `.input-select`. Added `.input` to the shared selector so font, height, padding and border match the rest of the app.
- **Settings loaded from wrong path on startup** — `run_app.py` loaded `.env` from the bundle path at startup, ignoring the user-directory settings file we fixed in v2.5.1. Now loads from `~/Library/Application Support/IDJLM Pro/.env` first.
- **No log file** — Errors from the bundled app were invisible. Now writes to `~/Library/Logs/IDJLM Pro/idjlm.log` (macOS) / `~/.idjlm-pro/logs/idjlm.log` (other). Rotating, max 2 MB × 3 backups.

---

## [2.5.2] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Genre not shown before AI classification** — `final_genre` now falls back to the file's existing genre tag (`existing_genre`). Tracks with genres already tagged in their files now show them immediately after import, before AI runs.
- **Wave column removed** — The "Wave" column showed waveform thumbnails only after audio analysis (librosa). Before analysis it always showed `—`. Removed entirely — it added visual noise without value at the typical workflow stage.

### Improvements
- **Set Planner arc button font** — Arc type buttons (Warm-Up, Peak Hour, etc.) now use the same 14px font as other form controls instead of the slightly-smaller 0.82rem.

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Settings lost on every launch (DMG)** — Settings were saved to `.env` at a path relative to the app bundle. When launched directly from a mounted DMG (read-only filesystem), writes failed silently and all settings were gone on next open. Settings now stored in `~/Library/Application Support/IDJLM Pro/.env` (macOS) or `~/.idjlm-pro/.env` (other platforms) — a user-writable location that persists across DMG launches, app updates, and reinstalls. Existing settings are migrated automatically on first launch.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Organise tab crash** — `initOrganiseTab()` was called from `switchTab()` but never defined, causing `ReferenceError` every time the Organise tab was clicked. Now defined; wires all buttons (health refresh, parse filenames, organise preview/run, key validator, duplicate scan) and triggers a health load on first visit.
- **Set Planner tab crash** — Same issue: `initSetPlanTab()` was called but never defined. Now defined; loads arc options, populates genre filter from taxonomy, and wires the Generate Set button.
- **Bulk edit modal buttons dead** — Save / Cancel / × buttons on the bulk-edit modal had no event listeners. Wired in `initBulkSelectFeature()`.
- **Bulk edit ID mismatch** — `handleBulkEdit()` read from `bulk-edit-genre/subgenre/bpm/year` but the HTML modal uses `bulk-genre/subgenre/bpm/year`. Fixed all four IDs.
- **Bulk edit genre select empty** — `showBulkEditModal()` now populates the genre `<select>` from `window.taxonomy` before opening.
- **Setlist never rendered** — `renderSetlist()` used wrong container IDs (`setlist-current-tracks` → `setlist-tracks`; `setlist-suggestions` → `setlist-suggestions-container`). Fixed. Empty-state / main-panel show/hide now works correctly using the static HTML elements.
- **Setlist footer overwritten** — `renderSetlist()` was dynamically replacing footer innerHTML, destroying the static Export M3U button. Now updates only `setlist-count` and `setlist-duration` span text.
- **`initSetlistTab()` silently bailed** — Was checking for the wrong container IDs (same mismatch), always returned early. Fixed and now called from `DOMContentLoaded`.
- **Export modal never wired** — `btn-export-csv/json/rekordbox` had no event listeners. Wired in `initBulkSelectFeature()` alongside the close button. Export modal can now be opened via the new "Export" button in the bulk-action bar.

### Improvements
- **Export button in bulk-action bar** — Selecting tracks and clicking "Export" now opens the Export Library modal (CSV / JSON / Rekordbox XML).
- **M3U export in setlist panel** — "Export M3U" button in the Set Planner setlist section now POSTs selected paths and triggers a download.

---

## [2.4.10] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **"Let's go" button unreadable on Pure Black theme** — `btn-primary` uses accent (`#e0e0e0`) as background with white text, making it invisible. Added `body.pure-black .btn-primary { color: #000000 }` so text is black on the near-white button.
- **Settings save not working** — `initSettingsTab()` was defined but never called from `DOMContentLoaded`; the Save button had no event listener attached. Fixed.
- **Settings threshold ID mismatch** — `saveSettings()` read from `settings-threshold` (non-existent) and referenced undefined `appState`; fixed to read from `settings-auto-approve` with safe fallback.
- **Track edit save → 404** — `saveTrackEdits()` used `encodeURIComponent(path)` in the URL path, but Flask's `<path:>` converter doesn't decode `%2F` as expected, causing lookup misses. Changed to `PUT /api/tracks/by-path?path=...` (query param). Same fix applied to the approve-button in the track table.
- **Bulk select bar never appeared** — JS referenced `id="bulk-actions-bar"` but HTML had `id="bulk-action-bar"` (no 's'). Fixed HTML id to match.
- **Audio playback failing** — `audio.play()` was called immediately after setting `audio.src` before the browser loaded the data. Added `audio.load()` before `audio.play()` in both `playTrack()` and `toggleAudioPlay()`. Also fixed `audio.src` absolute vs. relative comparison in `toggleAudioPlay()`.

### Improvements
- **One save button for Settings** — "Save All Settings" button now saves both API keys and taxonomy in one click. Separate "Save Taxonomy" button removed from UI.

---

## [2.4.9] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Tab switching broken** — Organise / Set Planner / Settings tabs were unclickable; `initNavigation()` was called in `DOMContentLoaded` but never defined. Added the function to wire `.nav-btn` click events to `switchTab()`.
- **Edit modal close/save/cancel broken** — `initEditModal()` was defined but never called on page load; all modal button listeners were never attached.
- **Audio player controls broken** — `initAudioPlayer()` was defined but never called; prev/next/seek/play-pause in the bottom bar didn't respond.
- **View details panel not opening** — `openTrackDetail()` toggled a CSS `.open` class but no CSS rule for that class existed; panel had inline `style="display:none"` that was never cleared. Fixed to use `style.display` directly. Also wired up the × close button and overlay-click to close.
- **Column preferences not loading** — `initColumnToggle()` was defined but never called; saved column visibility from localStorage was ignored on load.
- **Bulk select not wiring** — `initBulkSelectFeature()` and `initSearchFeature()` were defined but never called.

### Improvements
- **Default theme** — changed from `dark` to `pure-black`; new users no longer need to manually switch theme.
- **"Sub-Genre" renamed to "Comments"** — all UI labels (table column, edit modal, bulk edit, organise options, taxonomy editor, set planner filter) now read "Comments" to match industry terminology.

---

## [2.4.8] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Logo layout** — "IDJLM Pro" and version were stacking vertically (wrong CSS class `logo-container` → `logo`); now inline on one row with correct alignment

### Improvements
- **Native folder picker** — clicking "Change" or "Choose Folder" now opens a native OS folder dialog instead of a text input; no more typing file paths manually. Falls back to text input in dev/browser mode.

---

## [2.4.7] — 2026-04-05

### Improvements
- **Version in sidebar** — app version now shown next to "IDJLM Pro" in top-left (e.g. `IDJLM Pro v2.4.7`); reads from bundled VERSION file at runtime
- **PyInstaller bundle** — VERSION file now included in macOS DMG and Windows ZIP builds so version displays correctly in the packaged app

---

## [2.4.6] — 2026-04-05

### Improvements
- **Spotify dev link** — "Get credentials ↗" link to developer.spotify.com/dashboard added inline next to the Spotify Enrichment section label in Settings
- **Save Settings confirmation** — clicking Save now always shows a "Settings saved" toast; previously showed nothing when API key fields were empty (keys already saved appear masked in placeholders, so inputs look empty)

---

## [2.4.5] — 2026-04-05

### Features
- **4-theme system** — sidebar now shows 4 colour swatches; click to switch theme instantly
  - **Purple Dark** — original design (unchanged)
  - **Pro Booth** — amber/orange on deep charcoal; Pioneer CDJ/rekordbox aesthetic
  - **Studio Dark** — cyan on navy; Ableton/DAW aesthetic
  - **Pure Black** — true black with white typography; Spotify/Apple Music aesthetic
- Theme selection persists across sessions via `localStorage`

---

## [2.4.4] — 2026-04-05

### Native App (run_app.py)
- **Random port** — Flask now binds to a free ephemeral port instead of hardcoded 5050; overridable via `FLASK_PORT` env var
- **Close confirmation dialog** — pywebview window now prompts "Are you sure you want to close?" before quitting (prevents accidental data loss mid-session)

---

## [2.4.3] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Sort failure on null fields** — sorting by confidence/BPM/year no longer silently falls back to wrong order when values are None
- **Edited status never reverted** — clearing all overrides now correctly reverts track status from `edited` back to `pending`
- **Bulk-edit validation bypass** — `/api/review/bulk-edit` now validates BPM/key/year identically to the single-track endpoint

### Features
- **Harmonic mix suggestions** — `/api/mixes/compatible/<path>` endpoint now exists; returns top 10 compatible tracks by Camelot key (±1) + BPM (±8%)
- **Rekordbox INITIALKEY** — tag writer now writes `TXXX:INITIALKEY` alongside `TKEY` for full Rekordbox/Serato compatibility
- **Latin metadata in ID3** — clave pattern, energy score, vocal flag, tempo category now written as `COMM` frames (portable to all DJ tools)
- **Classifier clave + comment hints** — detected clave pattern and existing COMMENT tag now included in AI classification prompt; style hints added for Bachata/Salsa subgenre disambiguation
- **API retry with backoff** — Claude/Gemini rate limit errors (429) now retry 3× with 30s/60s/120s delays before falling back
- **Skip already-classified tracks** — "Classify All" skips tracks already classified; add `"force": true` to request body to reclassify all
- **Onboarding modal** — first-time users see a 6-step quick-start guide (dismissed via localStorage)
- **Setlist persistence** — setlist survives page refresh via localStorage; "Clear Setlist" button added

---

## [2.4.2] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **M3U export** — was broken; now uses native `fetch()` instead of `apiFetch()` so blob download works
- **Bulk selection** — never activated due to wrong DOM id (`track-table-body` → `tracks-tbody`)
- **Apple Music sync** — was sending full library instead of selection; fixed `Set.length` → `Set.size`
- **Review keyboard shortcuts (a/s)** — were no-ops; added missing `data-approve-btn`/`data-skip-btn` attributes
- **Stale folder path on session resume** — old sessions without `folder_path` metadata no longer corrupt auto-save path
- **Stack traces** — no longer leaked to frontend; all routes now log server-side and return generic error messages
- **Bulk approve parameter** — frontend/backend mismatch fixed (`threshold` → `min_confidence`; backend now accepts both)
- **Approval log race condition** — concurrent write-tag threads now use a lock to prevent log corruption

### Improvements
- **Search debounce** — 300ms debounce on library search; no more UI freeze while typing
- **Track table pagination** — 100 tracks per page with prev/next controls; eliminates browser slowdown on large libraries
- **Input validation** — BPM (40–300), Key (≤10 chars), Year (1900–2030) validated before saving; returns 400 on invalid input

---

## [2.4.1] — 2026-04-05

### Improvements
- **Gemini 2.0-flash** — classifier upgraded from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash` for better genre accuracy
- **Auto-save after classify & write-tags** — session persisted automatically so progress is never lost between steps
- **Keyboard navigation** — ↑/↓ arrows to move between tracks, Space to approve selected row
- **Threshold input** — confidence threshold is now an inline editable number field (was static text); value persists via `localStorage`
- **New app icon** — Nano Banana-generated vinyl record icon with purple-to-cyan gradient and neon waveform

### Bug Fixes (Codex-reviewed)
- **NaN threshold guard** — `parseInt("")` on cleared threshold input now falls back to `80` instead of `NaN`
- **Stale folder path on session resume** — `_current_folder_path` now restored from session metadata on load so auto-save works correctly in resumed sessions

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-05

![v2.4.0 screenshot](docs/screenshot-v2.4.0.png)

### UI Redesign — Single Library View
- **Sidebar trimmed to 4 items** — Library, Organise, Set Planner, Settings
- **Library toolbar** — folder picker + Analyze All + Classify All + Approve ≥N% + Write Tags on one row
- **Inline stats bar** — total/analyzed/classified/approved always visible; progress bar appears during pipeline runs
- **Inline approve column** — approve/unapprove per row, no Review tab needed
- **SSE progress** — analyze/classify/write-tags progress shown inline in stats bar
- **Removed standalone tabs** — Import, Review, Stats, Taxonomy, Setlist, Wheel, Duplicates; content folded into Library / Settings / Set Planner / Organise
- **No backend changes** — all API routes unchanged

---

## [2.3.2] — 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **Track data missing in UI** — `Track.to_dict()` used `dataclasses.asdict()` which excludes `@property` methods; all computed fields (`final_genre`, `final_bpm`, `final_key`, `display_title`, `display_artist`, `final_subgenre`, `final_year`, `final_comment`) now explicitly included in the serialised dict
- **Audio playback broken** — audio route changed from `/api/audio/<path:file_path>` to `/api/audio?path=...` (query param); `encodeURIComponent` was encoding `/` → `%2F` making Flask `os.path.abspath()` resolve to wrong path
- **Edit modal couldn't be closed** — JS errors from undefined track properties prevented event handlers; root cause fixed; Escape key handler added as belt-and-braces
- **Session lost on browser refresh** — session now auto-saved immediately after every import
- **No UX guidance after import** — toast now says "click Analyze All to extract BPM & key"; app auto-switches to Tracks tab after import so user can see what was loaded

### Track Model
- Added `override_comment` field and `final_comment` property (falls back to `proposed_subgenre` then `existing_comment`)

---

## [2.3.1] — 2026-04-05

### Launch UX
- **Splash screen on startup** — animated loading screen appears immediately when the app launches; no more blank bounce in the Dock for 5+ minutes on first run
- **Smart Flask wait** — app polls for Flask readiness instead of a fixed sleep; swaps splash → main UI the moment the server is up
- **Reduced bundle size** — excludes matplotlib, IPython, jupyter, notebook, test/unittest from PyInstaller build; cuts cold-start Gatekeeper scan time on macOS

### App Icon
- **Custom vinyl record icon** — dark rounded-square background, purple→teal gradient label, subtle groove rings, three-dot AI motif; generated from `assets/make_icon.py`
- macOS `.icns` and Windows `.ico` both auto-generated during CI build via `assets/make_icon.py` (Pillow); `iconutil` used on macOS runner for full multi-resolution `.icns`

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-05

### Organise Tab
- **Library Health Dashboard** — live stats: total, analyzed, classified, approved, tags written, duplicates; coverage bars for BPM/Key/Energy/Artwork; genre breakdown
- **Filename → Tag Parser** — scans tracks named "Artist - Title.mp3" with missing tags, previews parsed values vs existing tags, apply individually or all at once
- **Folder Auto-Organiser** — move approved tracks into `Genre/Sub-Genre/` (or `Genre/` or `Genre/Sub-Genre/Year/`) folder structure; dry-run preview before committing moves
- **Key Accuracy Validator** — compares stored Camelot keys against librosa-detected keys; flags mismatches of ≥2 Camelot steps; one-click fix individual or all

### Set Planner Tab
- **Energy Arc Set Planner** — auto-builds a DJ set shaped to Warm-Up, Peak Hour, Cool-Down, or Full Night arc; configurable duration, genre filter, BPM range
- **Arc visualiser** — canvas preview of the selected energy curve
- **Export as M3U** — download the generated set directly as an M3U playlist

### Audio Intelligence (computed during Analysis)
- **Vocal / Instrumental detector** — classifies each track as "vocal", "instrumental", or "mostly_instrumental" using harmonic separation + spectral flatness + MFCC variance; confidence 0–100
- **Tempo category** — genre-aware slow/medium/fast label (Bachata, Kizomba, Salsa, etc. each have calibrated BPM thresholds)

### Track Table
- Added Clave column (was in JS but missing from HTML header — fixed)
- Added Vocal column (badge: blue=Vocal, green=Instr., orange=Mostly Instr.)
- Added Tempo column (badge: red=Fast, orange=Medium, blue=Slow)

### Automation
- GitHub Actions workflow — auto-builds macOS DMG + Windows ZIP and creates GitHub release on every `v*.*.*` tag push
- `CHANGELOG.md` extracted from README into its own file; release notes populated automatically per version

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-04

### Latin DJ Features (djay Pro add-on)
- **Clave pattern detector** — auto-detects 2-3 vs 3-2 clave in Salsa/Son/Mambo tracks using onset correlation templates; confidence score 0–100
- **Montuno detector** — locates rhythmic breakdown entry point via spectral flux peaks
- **Smart cue points** — 4 auto-detected positions per track: Beat 1 (first downbeat), Montuno/Drop entry, Main hook (highest onset density), Outro (energy drop below 40% of peak)
- **Mix compatibility score** — 0–100 score across BPM proximity (25 pts, double/half BPM aware), Camelot wheel distance (35 pts), energy match (20 pts), genre match (20 pts)
- **Tag validator** — flags tracks with missing BPM, missing key, low-confidence genre, and non-standard Camelot notation
- **Cue sheet export** — JSON export of suggested cue points per track, filterable by genre
- **M3U playlist splitter** — configurable chunk size (100 / 500 / 1000 tracks per file, default 500); exports as ZIP of multiple M3U files
